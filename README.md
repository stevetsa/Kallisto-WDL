This tutorial assumes basic knowledge of WDL.  Refer to "Related Resources" on the bottom of the page for additional tutorials.

1) Create FireCloud workspace.  You should get a Google bucket link after you create a workspace (fc-.....)
2) Modify the URLs in kallisto_sample.txt to reflect the Google bucket associate with the workspace in 1).
3) Upload reads_1.fastq.gz, reads_2.fastq.gz, transcripts.index and transcripts.fasta.gz to your bucket. 
(transcripts.index is created by running kallisto index -i transcripts.index transcripts.fasta.gz)
4) Under "Data" tab, click on "Import Data" and upload kallisto_participants.txt, kallisto_samples.txt, kallisto_sample_set.txt and kallisto_sample_set_membership.txt in that order.
5) Under "Method Configuration", click on "Import Configuration.." and upload the kallisto_cfg.wdl file
6) Run the analysis with "samples" and define "this.samples" at runtime.
